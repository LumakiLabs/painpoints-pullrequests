* Shownotes
In this episode of Pain points and pull requests, Fatimah and Carla discuss how they sliced and diced Youtube trending page and channel data to generate some interesting insights. They go over what targets they’d use to measure their success in producing content based on what they learned from their exploratory data analysis of these datasets. They also talk about the model they produced and what they did to make it perform better than other models used to predict the same target variable.
